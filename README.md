Summary, useful links,notes & scripts by YDEMY course 
#SAP BTP Training - From Basics to Advanced[Hands-On].
#IMPORTANT!
Creation of SAP HANA Cloud DB Instances isn't
possible in the way that described in this course, Cloud Foundry interface 
in the BTP cockpit was changed since this course was created( attached image with explanation).
With some changes I succeded to create DB Instances on the space level
but  login in HANA Cloud Central failed. 
So I used an additional material from another course:
#"Learn SAP Cloud with User & Role Management[Hands On]".


-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Explore SAP BTP Cockpit, Subbaccount,space, booster, entitlements,system landscape,
2. Create SAP HANA Cloud Instances( SAP HANA DB Instance & Data Lake Instance
 & Manage Created Instances in HANA Cloud Central(images attached).
